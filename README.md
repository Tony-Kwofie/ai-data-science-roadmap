# AI & Data Science Roadmap

Welcome to my 8-week journey to master Python for AI and Data Science! This repository contains weekly projects and learning materials to build skills in Python programming, data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and more.

## Project Overview

This project is structured to guide me through essential AI and Data Science concepts over 8 weeks. Each week, I tackle a new topic and complete a mini-project that helps solidify my understanding. By the end of this roadmap, I will have a comprehensive portfolio of AI/DS projects.

## Roadmap

### Week 1: Python Basics & Foundations
- **Focus**: Learn Python syntax, variables, data types, functions, and control flow (if-else, loops).
- **Mini Project**: Build a simple grade calculator.

### Week 2: Data Structures & Functions
- **Focus**: Master Python data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.) and functions.
- **Mini Project**: Build a contact book or shopping cart.

### Week 3: NumPy & Pandas
- **Focus**: Learn data manipulation using NumPy and Pandas.
- **Mini Project**: Analyze a real-world dataset (e.g., Titanic dataset).

### Week 4: Data Visualization
- **Focus**: Create plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Mini Project**: Visualize occupational safety or other datasets.

### Week 5: Introduction to Machine Learning
- **Focus**: Understand basic ML algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, KNN).
- **Mini Project**: Predict accident severity or classify risk levels.

### Week 6: Intermediate ML & Model Tuning
- **Focus**: Learn model improvement techniques (cross-validation, GridSearchCV).
- **Mini Project**: Build a risk prediction app using Streamlit.

### Week 7: Introduction to Deep Learning
- **Focus**: Build and train simple neural networks with TensorFlow or Keras.
- **Mini Project**: Classify text as high-risk vs. low-risk.

### Week 8: Final Project & Portfolio Building
- **Focus**: Apply all concepts in a final project.
- **Mini Project**: Build a full AI/DS solution with data analysis, machine learning, and a web app.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Streamlit
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Notebook Environment**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

## How to Use This Repository
- Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-data-science-roadmap.git`
- Explore each week's folder to see the progress.
- Each folder contains a mini-project related to that week's topic.
- To run Jupyter notebooks, make sure you have the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## My Learning Goals
- Master Python for AI and Data Science.
- Build a strong portfolio of machine learning and deep learning projects.
- Apply AI techniques in real-world applications, especially in the field of Occupational Health & Safety.
